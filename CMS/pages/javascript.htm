<p>CMS generates page links that call a JavaScript function to change the page. Since each 'page' is a DIV element shown and hidden at the appropriate time, there are no direct page links, only JavaScript function links.</p>
<p>The function protoype is as follows:</p>
<pre>
function do_page( pg )
&lbrace;

&rbrace;
</pre>
<p>pg is the page identifier as defined in the {page:directives,top-level} cms file. This function should hide the current page DIV, and show the new one. It can of course, perform any other function as required by your manual design.</p>
