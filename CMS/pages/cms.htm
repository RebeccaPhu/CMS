<p>This is the manual for CMS - The Compiled Manual Source processor.</p>
<p>CMS is a simple document processor for producing HTML-based manuals self-contained into one HTML file. The program works by parsing a {page:directives,top-level} document description file. This file defines some basic variables, as well as the list of document sources to include, including CSS and JavaScript files.</p>
<p>The resulting document is self-contained, with all CSS and JavaScript embedded inline, with all iamges embedded as Base64 datatypes. The result is a single HTML file that can be distributed without any other components.</p>
<p>The document is presented as an active document that selects visibility according to the currently selected page. However, it is not a requirement to build the page this way. See the {page:javascript} page for further information.</p>
<p>CMS was written by Rebecca Gellman, and is subject to the restrictions in the COPYING file that is part of the distribution.</p>
